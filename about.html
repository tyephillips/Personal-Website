                    <h2>Biography</h2>
                    <p>I am a resilient and resourceful individual, demonstrating initiative through 
                        running my own online business, organizing events, and crafting compelling digital experiences. 
                        My experience in homeschooling has equipped me with valuable skills in self-teaching, time management, 
                        and critical thinking.
                        I am an aspiring software developer and designer with a strong foundation in Python programming, 
                        web development, and branding. Proficient in frameworks such as Django and front-end technologies 
                        like HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, I also specialize in creating visually engaging content through Canva. 
                        From web design and UI/UX to social media branding and training materials, 
                        I combine creativity with technical expertise to build meaningful and impactful experiences.
                        I thrive in dynamic environments where I can apply my technical and organizational skills. 
                        As a fast learner with a fresh perspective, I bring innovation, adaptability, and dedication 
                        to every project. My fear of comfort drives me to continuously grow, push boundaries, and achieve concrete results.
                        Traveling the world has always been my biggest aspiration—it offers the opportunity to gain new experiences, 
                        diverse perspectives, and deeper insights into different cultures. Additionally,
                        I have a deep passion for spirituality and self-discovery, embracing the journey 
                        of understanding who I am and why I am the way I am.
                        With my diverse skills and determination, I am confident that this path will lead 
                        to countless opportunities. Whether you're here to explore my work, collaborate, or connect, 
                        I invite you to join me on this journey of growth, innovation, and creativity.

                    <h2>Hobbies & Interests</h2>
                    <p>Outside of coding and designing, I find joy in listening to music, running, and spending quality time 
                        with my family. I’m also passionate about building software and taking on projects during 
                        my free time that truly resonates with who I am. These activities help me recharge, stay 
                        creative, and align my work with my values. I believe in the power of meaningful 
                        projects to drive growth, both professionally and personally.

                    <h2>Goals</h2>
                    <p>My mind right now is only set on growth, whether its professionally or personally all I want to do is grow.
                        With that being said, my short-term and long-term goal as a software engineer/designer is to grow, and I want to be part of 
                        a team that will aid me in doing that.
