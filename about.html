                    <h2>Biography</h2>
                    <p>Tye Phillips I am a resilient and resourceful individual, demonstrating initiative 
                        through running my own online business and organizing events. My experience in 
                        homeschooling has equipped me with valuable skills in self-teaching, time management, 
                        and critical thinking. I am an aspiring software developer with a strong foundation in 
                        Python programming, web development, and relational database management. Proficient in 
                        frameworks such as Django and front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. 
                        Skilled in Agile development methodologies, ensuring iterative progress and collaboration. 
                        I am actively seeking opportunities to apply my technical and organizational skills in a 
                        dynamic team environment As a fast learner with a a fresh perspective, I can be a valuable 
                        asset to any team. I thrive on personal growth and my fear of comfort motivates me to deliver 
                        my best and achieve concrete results. Traveling the world has always been my biggest aspiration; 
                        It is an opportunity to gain new experiences and diverse perspectives. Embracing new cultures 
                        enriches my understanding of myself and the world around me. Additionally, I have a deep passion 
                        for spirituality, and I am dedicated to exploring who I am and why I am the way I am. 
                        I confidently embrace this journey, knowing that my diverse skills and determination will 
                        lead to countless opportunities</p>

                    <h2>Hobbies & Interests</h2>
                    <p>Outside of coding, I find joy in listening to music, running, and spending quality time 
                        with my family. Iâ€™m also passionate about building software and taking on projects during 
                        my free time that truly resonate with who I am. These activities help me recharge, stay 
                        creative, and align my work with my personal values. I believe in the power of meaningful 
                        projects to drive growth, both professionally and personally.

                    <p>My mind right now is only set on growth whether its professionally or personal all I want to do is grow.
                        With that being said my short-term and long-term goal as a software engineer is to grow, and I want to be part of
